#   Computer dealer and a human player
#   Player starts with 2 cards face up, dealer starts with 1 card face up and 1 card face down
#   Player Goal: get closer to a total value of 21 than the dealer does.
#   Hit: grab another card from a deck and put on hand
#   Stay: stop receiving card
#   If the player goes over 21, he bust; he loses the bet; then dealer collects the money
#   jack, queen, king count as value of 10
#   Aces can be either 1 or 11
